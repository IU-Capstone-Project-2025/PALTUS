## Ideas for Gamification (Global)
1. **Streak for users**
   - Check daily activities of a user (subtopic or 
   lesson finished)
2. **Quiz based on a learnt lesson**
   - For completing a generated quiz on a lesson, the lesson will be shown as a special lesson
3. **Quizes for lessons, which were passed some time ago**
   - A quiz will be generated after some time after passing a lesson, after completing it, user will get so called rating (trophies e.g.)
