My goal is {goal} \
What I know about this topic: {knowledge} \
Course duration: {lessons} lessons, time for each lesson {time}. \
Give an answer on english in JSON format without any other text, do not change boolean fields, \
if the subject of course for generation is unclear or invalid just print error message: \
{ \
  "course_name": "Name of the course", \
  "description": "Optional", \
  "books": ["Useful books for the course"], \
  "lessons": [ \
    { \
      "lesson_number": 1, \
      "title": "Title of this lesson", \
      "quiz": false, \
      "subtopics": [ \
        { \
          "topic": "Subtopic of the lesson", \
          "notes": "Short describing inforamtion about subtopic", \

    }, \
    { \
      "same type for each other lesson as in the lesson 1": "" \
    } \
  ] \
}
ai.prompt.quiz=Create a quiz from descibed Context. \
Generate 5 single-choice questions. \
Each question must have 4 options, only one of which is correct. \
Return the result in valid JSON format with no additional text. \
Do not invent unrelated topics or information. \
Use this strict format: \
{ \
  "quiz_title": "Quiz title based on the lesson", \
  "questions": [ \
    { \
      "question_id": 1, \
      "question_text": "Your question?", \
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"], \
      "correct_answer": 2, \
    }, \
    { \
      "question_id": 2, \
      "question_text": "Another question?", \
      "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], \
      "correct_answer": 0, \
    } \
  ] \
}

ai.prompt.system=You are a system that helps create a learning plan. \
Your output MUST be a valid, parsable JSON. \
Do NOT include any comments, extra text, markdown, or trailing commas. \
ALWAYS return a syntactically correct JSON with all brackets and commas properly placed. \
Always use valid syntax: quote all field names, separate array items with commas, and close all brackets correctly. \
Never embed objects inside others accidentally. \
Each `lesson` must be a separate object in the `lessons` array — do not nest one inside another. \
Before returning JSON, run it through a strict parser. \
Generate meaningful content for mutable fields: \
   - ALWAYS set "notes" for every subtopic \
   - ALWAYS set "finished": false for every subtopic \
   - description: summarize course purpose \
   - books: suggest relevant books \
   - lessons: create progressive structure \
   - subtopics: 1-4 per lesson \
   - NEVER add comments or explanations in JSON \

ai.prompt.systemResponder="you are a system that helps a user study a certain topic that you learn from the context, your goal is to respond to him, \
and in the case of a request unrelated to the context, output only the following message: {"error": "Improper content of request"} "

ai.prompt.editpaste=. Process this request and integrate it into the previously created course JSON. \
Strictly follow the original format and structure. \
Ensure that all objects and arrays are properly opened and closed — especially `lessons` and `subtopics`. \
Do not duplicate any keys inside JSON objects. \
Before returning the final result, validate the JSON using a strict JSON parser. \
Return ONLY the corrected and complete JSON. No additional comments or explanations are allowed.
